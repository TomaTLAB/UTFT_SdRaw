Re-written the loadS function to be AVR/ARM compliant and provided an Example,
also added descriptive headers to all of the examples.

Reorganised structure and added 'library.properties' file to conform to Library Spec V1.5.X

Added the ability to draw from Serial source. 

Just a SMALL update to remove the outdated #include <SdStream.h>

Also added a statistics file showing the speed increase in the ARM 800x480 example as a result of the latest SdFat version.

Thanks for downloading my UTFT_SdRaw library, please give me some 'Karma' on the forum if you appreciate my efforts.
